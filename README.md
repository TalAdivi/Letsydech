"Letsydech" is a women's rehab center that asked us to build them an accessible website.

This website was built as part of Google DSC project, in which foundations ask for technological solution for their needs.

For that purpose we built a high standard accessible responsive dynamic website

The website contains information about the center, allows to address inquiries easily and to donate via Paypal/Credit card.

In addition, we provide them a CMS platform to control the website content (e.g. photos, information, stories) in easy and intuitive way.
